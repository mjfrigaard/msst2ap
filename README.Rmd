# `msst2ap`

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `msst2ap` (Mastering shiny `shinytest2` app-package) is to demonstrate how to test a shiny application package using [`testthat`](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) and [`shinytest2`]()

## Installation

You don't *have* to install the `msst2ap` package, but you might want to download it as an example (or read through [this post](https://mjfrigaard.github.io/posts/test-shiny-p4/) to learn about it's contents).

```{r}
library(msst2ap)
```


## Utility function tests

There is a single utility function in `msst2ap`: `find_vars()`

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
fs::dir_tree("tests/testthat/", regexp = "find")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
testthat::test_file("tests/testthat/test-find_vars.R")
```

```{verbatim}
#> [ FAIL 0 | WARN 0 | SKIP 0 | PASS 4 ]
```


## `testServer()` tests

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
fs::dir_tree("tests/testthat/", regexp = "Server|App")
```

```{verbatim}
🐝 Your tests are the bee's knees 🐝
```
